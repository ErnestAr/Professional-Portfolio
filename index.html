                            Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the
                        estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I
                        see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way
                        to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a
                        nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that I ought to
                        use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.
                        <br>
                            It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him
                        life. While everyone around him was in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. The
                        doctor said it would be less than a year. That gave him a year to live, something he'd failed to
                        do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then.
                        <br>
                            He walked down the steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry knowing the secrets in the
                        briefcase must be secured as quickly as possible. Bounding down the steps, he heard something
                        behind him and quickly turned in a panic. There was nobody there but a pair of old worn-out
                        shoes were placed neatly on the steps he had just come down. Had he past them without seeing
                        them? It didn't seem possible. He was about to turn and be on his way when a deep chill filled
                        his body.

                                    He heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result. It had been so loud that it had
                                actually made him jump back in his seat. As soon as he recovered from the surprise, he
                                saw the crack in the windshield. It seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of
